# Real_Estate_App
    A real estate web-platform with Django&amp;Bootstrap
  For my graduation project from a "Python from scratch" course, I`ve created a real estate website in Django + Bootstrap. 
Initially wanted a small website for the final project but when an acquaintance told me to develop the website for his new real estate business,
it turned out to in a full webplatform, ready to use in production. So this is the alpha version (1.00) of the website, more functionalities will be implemented in
the future.
