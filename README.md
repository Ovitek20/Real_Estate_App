# Real_Estate_App
    A real estate web-platform with Django&amp;Bootstrap
    
  For my graduation project from a "Python from scratch" course, I`ve created a real estate website in Django + Bootstrap. 

Functionalities:
    - Manage listings, realtors, contact inquiries and website users via admin
    - Display listings in app with pagination
    - Ability to set listings to unpublished
    - Search listings by keyword, city, state, bedrooms and price (Homepage & search page)
    - List realtors on about page with “seller of the month” (Control via admin)
    - The Listing page has fields listed below
    - Lightbox for scrolling through images
    - The Listing page has a form to submit inquiry for that property listing
    - Form info goes to the database and notify realtor(s) with an email
    - Frontend register/login to track inquiries
    - Both unregistered and registered users can submit form. If registered, can only submit one per listing

Possible Future Functionality:
    - Google maps on listing page
    - Buyer testimonials


So this is the alpha version (1.00) of the website, more functionalities will be implemented in
the future.
